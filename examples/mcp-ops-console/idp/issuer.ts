/**
 * The OpenAuth issuer — a REAL, self-hosted Authorization Server (Hono app) that mints
 * signed JWT access tokens and publishes a JWKS. This is the wedge's interim real issuer
 * (ADR 0039): a batteries-included standards OAuth server, not a from-scratch build.
 *
 * `buildIssuer()` returns a Hono app you serve on Node/Bun (local) or export from a Worker
 * (deploy). It serves `/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server` (discovery) + JWKS, and the
 * `/authorize` → `/token` (PKCE) flow. The access token it signs is ES256 and carries
 * `{ sub, aud: <clientID>, iss, exp, properties }` — so the grant's MCP scopes ride in the
 * subject `properties` (OpenAuth has no OAuth `scope` claim); the RS reads them back via the
 * `VerifyAccessToken` seam (../mcp/verify.ts).
 *
 * For a hermetic demo + CI, three providers below auto-issue a FIXED identity with no login UI:
 *   - `sre`     — an SRE: `mcp:read mcp:write`, role `sre` (the full-control operator);
 *   - `oncall`  — an on-call responder: `mcp:read mcp:write`, role `oncall` (writes today; the
 *                 OCP-7 policy floor would later scope them to incidents, not deploy gating);
 *   - `viewer`  — a read-only stakeholder: `mcp:read`, role `viewer`.
 * The role is selected by the client via `?provider=`. The real `/authorize → code → /token`
 * PKCE dance still runs end to end; only the human login step is stubbed. A production
 * deployment swaps these for OpenAuth's real providers (password, code, GitHub/Google, …).
