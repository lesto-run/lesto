/**
 * The Postgres `LISTEN/NOTIFY` transport (ADR 0040 Phase A, `L-ee9433f8`).
 *
 * One dedicated long-lived listening client per process — NOT from the `@lesto/db`
 * pool, because `LISTEN` pins a connection for the process's life and a pooled
 * client would starve normal queries. All processes `LISTEN` one channel
 * (`lesto_invalidate`) with the invalidation **topic** in the `NOTIFY` payload; a
 * received topic is re-published into the local in-process hub, where per-topic and
 * per-connection fan-out happens. Authz stays in the app (where the principal
 * lives), never in the database.
 *
 * **Ordering is the commit-ordered NOTIFY delivery stream, not a `SEQUENCE`.**
 * Postgres delivers `NOTIFY` to every listener in commit order, identically, so a
 * single node's receive stream IS commit-ordered — the cursor never needs a
 * fleet-global number. A `LISTEN` gap (the connection dropped) means missed
 * `NOTIFY`s (Postgres does not buffer them), so **every re-LISTEN bumps the replay
 * generation** (the injected {@link PostgresTransportOptions.bumpGeneration}),
 * making the gap detectable: a cursor from before the gap can no longer prove
 * continuity and is forced to resync.
 *
 * This module is the pure transport LOGIC, driven against an injected
 * {@link PgListenClient} seam so every branch is tested; the real `pg.Client`
 * factory (`createPgListenClient`) is the thin coverage-excluded wiring.
