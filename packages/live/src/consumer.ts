/**
 * `connectLiveData` — the browser consumer of the local-first data stream (ADR 0042 Tier
 * 4, v0). It opens the app's `GET /__lesto/live-data` Server-Sent-Events endpoint for a
 * bound shape and maps each frame onto a {@link LiveStore}: a `snapshot` replaces the whole
 * slice, a `change` sets/removes one row, and a `resync` drops the slice to await the next
 * snapshot. Unlike `@lesto/ui`'s `connectLive` (which drives a `QueryClient` off a
 * *topic*), this wire carries auth-scoped ROW DATA — the deliberate ADR 0042 vs 0027 split.
 *
 * The `EventSource` seam is injected exactly like `@lesto/ui/src/live.ts`, for the same two
 * reasons: a test drives the whole stream through a fake, and importing this module stays
 * SSR-safe because the global `EventSource` is touched only inside the default's `open`,
 * never at import or during a render. This file keeps no React dependency — the store it
 * drives is framework-agnostic, and the React binding lives in `@lesto/ui`.

 *
 * **Deliberately excludes `id`/`lastEventId` — the wire cursor is opaque to this module.**
 * The native `EventSource` DOES carry the frame's cursor as `MessageEvent.lastEventId` and
 * transparently echoes it back as the reconnect `Last-Event-ID` header — but every handler in
 * {@link connectLiveData} is written against this narrower type, so TypeScript refuses any
 * attempt to read, compare, or parse the cursor here (a compile error, not a convention). The
 * server (`@lesto/live-server`'s `encodeResumeCursor`, and the poll path's `pollCursor`) mints a
 * versioned, opaque token specifically so neither side ever needs to treat it as more than a
 * round-tripped string — the property that let ADR 0042 Inc4's LSN-exact resume upgrade the wire
 * from the `v0:` counter to a `v1:(systemId, timelineId, LSN)` token additively rather than as a
 * breaking wire change. Do not widen this interface to add `id`/`lastEventId` without a strong
 * reason; doing so would remove the one thing enforcing that invariant at compile time.
