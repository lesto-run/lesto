/**
 * The remote MCP transport: Streamable-HTTP, mounted by the app (ADR 0028 Phase 3b).
 *
 * Like `server.ts` (the stdio transport), this is pure wiring behind a coverage
 * exclusion — it owns NO governance. Every security decision is made by the tested
 * logic in `http.ts` (the `Origin` guard, the `401`/`403` `WWW-Authenticate` challenges,
 * the scope→mode ceiling, and the per-tool policy floor) and `tools.ts` (`buildTools`/
 * `dispatch` and their audit + operator gate); this file only carries those decisions
 * onto HTTP and drives the `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` Streamable-HTTP transport.
 *
 * **Mounted by the app, never the kernel.** `@lesto/mcp` already depends on
 * `@lesto/kernel`; if the kernel mounted this, that edge would close a cycle. So the
 * factory returns plain `@lesto/web` handlers the *application* registers on its own
 * chain (a grep-asserted invariant — no `kernel → mcp` import).
 *
 * **Per-request identity (seam decision `L-15fd2238`, option a).** A bearer subject is
 * per-request, but `LestoMcpContext.resolvePrincipal` is a zero-arg thunk. So each
 * request gets a FRESH `runContext` + `buildTools` whose `resolvePrincipal` closes over
 * *that* request's authenticated session — request-scoped DI, concurrency-safe, no shared
 * state and no signature change. `buildTools` is cheap.
 *
 * **Confused-deputy defaults.** The mode is derived from the token's scopes and floors to
 * `read-only` (a read-scoped token reaches no write); the tool set is exactly
 * `buildTools` — there is no impersonation tool to register; and a request audienced
 * elsewhere never authenticates (the RS rejects it in `http.ts`).
