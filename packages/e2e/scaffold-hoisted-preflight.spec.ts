/**
 * The MUTABLE-TREE HOISTED dev-boot preflight (L-513dd8a6) — the pre-publish CANARY for the
 * L-27285131 hang class. Run BEFORE a publish (dispatch / nightly) it would have caught the hang;
 * it is NOT yet wired into `release.yml` as a blocking gate (a follow-up — and one that must land
 * only AFTER the fix, since a blocking gate on the still-hung tree would deadlock the 0.1.3 release
 * that ships the fix).
 *
 * ⚠️ STRUCTURALLY BLIND to the L-27285131 defect (established 2026-07-04, L-3daa1173) — do NOT treat a
 * green here as "the published default path is fine." The defect only reproduces on the REAL npm-resolved
 * published closure under a Node undici `fetch()` client; this spec is a LOCAL PACK (`packLestoClosure`
 * pins the whole `@lesto/*` graph to `file:` tarballs via `overrides`), and every local pack GREENS under
 * undici — including of published-0.1.2's own byte-identical source (overlay bisect run 28719740861, all
 * SHAs green). So this leg CANNOT redden on that class (the `scaffold-e2e-masks-real-resolution` trap). It
 * still earns its keep as install/build + hoisted-layout coverage; the faithful published-closure dev-boot
 * check (verdaccio) is the re-scoped L-513dd8a6 deliverable. curl is likewise a FALSE ORACLE here.
 *
 * `scaffold-real-install.spec.ts` has two legs, and NEITHER boots `lesto dev` under the hoisted
 * linker against a FIXABLE tree:
 *   - leg (a) boots the PUBLISHED closure hoisted — but that closure is IMMUTABLE, so when its dev
 *     hangs (published 0.1.2 never answers the first `GET /` under hoisted-on-Linux — a true hang
 *     confirmed at 300s) there is no repo-side fix; the leg can only SKIP its dev boot until a
 *     republish. That is precisely why the hang was only discoverable POST-publish.
 *   - leg (b) boots the CURRENT tree — but under the ISOLATED linker, which does NOT reproduce the
 *     hang (the same dev code answers fine isolated on the same Linux runner).
 *
 * The uncovered quadrant — CURRENT tree × HOISTED linker — is the one a real `bun create lesto &&
 * cd app && bun install && lesto dev` user actually gets, because HOISTED is bun's standalone-scaffold
 * DEFAULT. This spec fills it: pack the current `@lesto/*` closure to tarballs, scaffold via the
 * in-repo `create-lesto`, pin onto the tarballs, then `bun install --linker=hoisted`, build, boot
 * `lesto dev`, and assert the FIRST `GET /` answers. Since the published dev code == the tree, this
 * SHOULD reproduce the L-27285131 hang on a FIXABLE target (see the ⚠️ above — unconfirmed on Linux)
 * — so a fix can be red/greened here on Linux CI instead of only against the immutable published
 * leg (a), and this becomes the standing pre-publish canary against a regression of the same class.
 *
 * On macOS (where the hang does NOT reproduce — hoisted dev answers in ~24ms) and once the Linux hang
 * is fixed, this passes fast. On the still-hung path the first-GET wait is BOUNDED (120s, well under
 * the 600s hook budget) so it fails FAST with a named message rather than hanging the whole job.
