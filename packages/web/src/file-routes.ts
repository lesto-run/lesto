/**
 * Apply file-based routes onto a `lesto()` app — the impure half of the
 * convention `@lesto/router`'s pure compiler sets up.
 *
 * `@lesto/router` owns the path math: it scans the convention dir (`app/`) and
 * compiles each `page`/`layout` file into an ordered {@link FileRoute} descriptor —
 * a URL pattern, its kind, and (for a page) the depths of the layouts that wrap
 * it. This module takes those descriptors plus the LOADED modules they name and
 * turns them into ordinary `.page()` registrations on a {@link Lesto} instance, so
 * a file-route and a hand-written route live on ONE router with no second engine.
 *
 * The split is deliberate: the descriptor compiler is pure and 100%-tested over
 * literal inputs with no filesystem, and the module LOADING (a dynamic `import`
 * per file) is the bin's job — this applier sees only already-resolved modules, so
 * it too is pure over its inputs. The bin's loop is the only place that touches
 * `import()`.
 *
 * Per-page layouts, not a global chain. The code-first `.layout()` adds a layout
 * to every page declared AFTER it — a single, app-wide stack. File-routes need
 * something finer: a `layout.tsx` under `listings/` wraps the listings pages but
 * NOT the marketing ones, and the chain differs per branch of the tree. So rather
 * than push onto the app's `layoutChain`, the applier composes each page's own
 * layout chain into a wrapper component and registers THAT — reusing the existing
 * `.page()` path wholesale (load, metadata, `static`, `cache` all pass through
 * untouched), with the per-branch nesting living inside the page's component.

 * suspended render reveals the loading fallback.
 *
 * THE SUSPENSE IS LOAD-BEARING for the error/not-found boundaries under streaming
 * SSR, not just for `loading`. React's `renderToReadableStream` REJECTS the whole
 * render if a throw escapes to the shell (outside every `<Suspense>`); inside a
 * boundary it instead isolates that subtree (emitting client-recovery markers) and
 * keeps the shell. So whenever an `error`/`not-found` boundary is present we wrap
 * the page in a Suspense even without a `loading` file (an empty fallback), so a
 * page throw never tears down the document — the error/404 boundary then renders
 * its view on the CLIENT after hydration (the same model as Next's client `error.tsx`).
 * A `loading` file supplies a real fallback for that same Suspense.
